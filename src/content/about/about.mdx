title: About Me
description: >-
  I’m a frontend developer passionate about building intuitive, accessible user
  interfaces that combine thoughtful UX/UI design with solid engineering
  practices. I enjoy transforming complex requirements into clean, user-friendly
  solutions, ensuring every feature is not only visually polished but also
  performant and reliable. Working with React, TypeScript, and modern tools like
  TailwindCSS and ShadCN allows me to craft scalable applications that integrate
  seamlessly with REST APIs.

My professional journey began with backend development during my internship, where I built APIs in FastAPI and worked with data processing in Python. Since then, I’ve grown into a frontend-focused role, contributing to a production system in an Agile Scrum environment. Over time, I’ve discovered that I enjoy working across the entire stack, and my goal is to grow as a full-stack developer - building not only engaging user interfaces but also the backend systems that power them end to end.
