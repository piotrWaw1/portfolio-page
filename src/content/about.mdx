I started my journey in web development back in 2018, tinkering with HTML and CSS to build simple websites. Since
then, I've had the privilege of working at a <span class="text-primary font-medium">startup</span>, a <span
class="text-accent font-medium">digital agency</span>, and a <span
class="text-cyan font-medium">large corporation</span>, building software for a diverse range of clients and use
cases.
